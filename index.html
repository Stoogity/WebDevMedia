        What is bouldering?
        <br></br>
        <div id="bouldering">
            <div id="btext">
            Bouldering is a climbing discipline which focuses on shorter "problems" without using a rope. Crash pads and spotters are used to protect 
            the climber. Boulder problems are typically much harder move for move when compared with either sport or traditional climbing. There are 
            different rating systems for grading difficulty used around the world. In the US we use the V scale, with V0 being the easiest and V17 
            being the absolute hardest. V0 is roughly equal to the hardest move on a roped 5.10a climb.
            It is an extremely popular discipline because it requires the least amount of gear for participation and is a very social discipline. 
            Groups of people will work on the same problem and take turns at it, sharing "beta" (information about how to complete the problem or 
            route) or cheering each other on. Bouldering, like sport climbing, is also an Olympic sport as of this year. Bouldering has a high rate of injury 
            because every time a climber falls, the climber is going to hit the ground. Ankle sprains are common.

        What is sport climbing?
        <br></br>
        <div id="sport">
        <div id="stext">
            Sport climbing is a relatively young discipline. Like bouldering, it focuses heavily on gymnastic movement. Unlike bouldering, 
            it requires a rope and quickdraws as well as a partner to belay the climber. Quickdraws are a type of equipment that 
            consists of two carabiners connected either with a nylon sling or more frequently a "dogbone". In order for a climb to be considered a 
            "sport climb", someone has to first identify a potential route and drill bolts into the rock at regular intervals. The climber 
            attaches quickdraws to these bolts during the ascent and attaches the rope to the quickdraws. If the climber falls, the climber will 
            fall twice the distance to the last bolt they clipped in to. For example, if a climber is 5 feet above the last quickdraw and falls, they will 
            fall a minimum of 10 feet. It is generally the safest type of climbing since most sport routes are vertical or steeper than vertical, and therefore
            the climber falls into air and doesn't hit anything. The difficulty rating system is different than bouldering. In the US, we use the Yosemite 
            Decimal System (YDS). In theory, the easiest sport climb is 5.1, although the easiest I've actually heard of is 5.2. The hardest sport climb is rated
            5.15d and is located in the Flatanger Cave in Norway. The route is called Silence. I've attached the video for Silence which was a major achievement for climbing, 
            as well as the video about Margo Hayes making history by being the first woman to climb a 5.15. 100% worth the watch.

        What is trad climbing?
        <br></br>
        <div id="trad">
            <div class="ttext">
                Trad climbing is a very serious discipline of climbing and a much older discipline than the previous two. It is the most expensive to 
                get into as the gear required is not cheap and a climber needs a lot of it. Rather than bolts as in sport climbing, trad climbing requires the 
                climber to place camming devices (cams) or stoppers (commonly called nuts) into constrictions in the rock or cracks. The climber is restricted
                by whatever the route offers for placements. Sometimes gear is really easy to place and opportunities to place gear are plentiful. Other times 
                this is not the case. Additionally, if the gear is placed poorly then it will not hold a fall. This means that the climber must be able to place
                gear correctly while under stress. The climber must also pay attention to where they place gear - it is best practice to place gear such that the rope runs
                in as straight a line as possible, so as to eliminate rope drag which can cause gear to fail or prevent a climber from ascending.
                The technique for climbing in this style is generally different from bouldering and sport climbing as trad climbing frequently follows crack
                systems. Cracks are described by their size - finger, hand, fist, and off-width. Finger cracks are the smallest and can only accomodate a climber's
                fingers. Hand cracks fit a climbers hand with the tumb tucked. Fist cracks fit a climber's fists. Off-width describes any crack that doesn't fit
                into the other sizes. Trad climbs are graded on the same scale as sport climbs, although the two are generally very different from one another.
                A great sport climber may be a terrible trad climber and vice versa.

            <div class="ttext">
                Another very unique feature of trad climbing is that it permits multi-pitch climbing. A multi-pitch climb refers to any route that is too tall
                for a climber to ascend with one rope length. The leader will ascend to the top of a pitch (the length of a pitch depends on the climb, but is never longer than one rope length), builds and anchor, 
                and brings up the second climber. Then either the climbers swap leads or the original leader will lead the next pitch. This process continues until
                the party reaches the top or until the party decides to retreat back to the ground.
